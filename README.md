About the tools used

Github Actions: GitHub Actions is a powerful platform for automating software development workflows, including building, testing, and deploying applications. It was chosen for this task to improve speed and consistency

Helm: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications on a Kubernetes cluster. It provides a way to package, configure, and deploy Kubernetes applications with version control, which makes it easier to maintain, update, and roll back deployments. It was choosen for this task to simplify the deployment to EKS.

Terraform: Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure as code in a declarative manner. This means you describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform takes care of the details of how to create, modify, or delete resources to achieve that state. This is why it was chosen.
